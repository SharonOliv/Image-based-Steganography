# Image-based-Steganography
Hidden messages visible disguise
<br>This project implements image steganography to embed a secret image into a cover image using Python and OpenCV. The process involves converting the secret image into bytes and embedding these bytes into the cover image using a password for encryption. The resulting image, which appears identical to the original cover image, contains the hidden secret image.
